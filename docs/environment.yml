# Hard requirements for notebook examples and documentation build
# WARNING: Keep this up-to-date with ci/environment.yml
# * pyqt5 is needed by pyplot, RTD server *happens* to already have it
#   but creating local environment will fail.
# * jinja >= 3.0 and nbsphinx >= 0.8.2 seem to break default ReST roles when
#   jupytext notebooks are converted to HTML. Interpreted as italics instead.
# * docutils >= 0.17 breaks bullet points. See the following thread
#   for more info: https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/1115
