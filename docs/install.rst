Installation
------------

ClimoPy is published on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/climopy/>`__.
It can be installed or upgraded with ``pip`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install climopy
   pip install --upgrade climopy

The dependencies are `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, and `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_.
To use the (optional) `ECMWF <https://www.ecmwf.int/>`_ `ERA-Interim <https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/>`_ downloading tool, you will also need to install the `ECMWF python API <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets>`__.

..
  Note that I may consider merging this project with `MetPy <https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html>`__ eventually. But for the time being, MetPy cannot perform many of the objective and statistical analysis tasks used by climate scientists.
