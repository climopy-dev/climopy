        This package is meant to help climate scientists complete a variety of data analysis tasks.
        It provides handy functions for objective and statistical analysis methods, deriving physical quantities, and downloading archived observational and model data.
        The Github page is `here <https://github.com/lukelbd/climpy>`__.
        
        This is a work-in-progress -- currently, there is no formal release
        on PyPi. For the time being, you may install directly from Github using:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/climpy.git#egg=climpy
        
        I may consider merging this project with `MetPy <https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html>`_ eventually. But for the time being, MetPy cannot perform many of the objective and statistical analysis tasks used by climate scientists.
        
        The dependencies are `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, and `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_.
        To use the (optional) `ECMWF <https://www.ecmwf.int/>`_ `ERA-Interim <https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/>`_ downloading tool, you will also need to install the `ECMWF python API <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets>`_.
